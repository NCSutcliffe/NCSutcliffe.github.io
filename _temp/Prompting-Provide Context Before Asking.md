# Post 1: Provide Context Before Asking

In cybersecurity, AI can be powerful, but only if you teach it the rules of your game. Security professionals often expect Copilot or ChatGPT to "just know" what to do—but without context, you're rolling the dice.

If you're building a prompt for AI, consider this your golden rule: **Don't ask a question until you've set the scene.**

🧠 Think of it like onboarding a junior SOC analyst:
- Would you give them an empty prompt like "Summarise this"?
- Or would you say: "This is a monthly threat report for the banking sector. I want you to extract top ransomware trends, but ignore the geopolitical section."

It’s that level of guidance AI needs too.

Here’s how to frame it:
✅ “You’re an Information Security Manager at a financial services firm.”
✅ “This is a weekly endpoint detection report.”
✅ “Our audience is a CIO who wants key actions in plain English.”

By simply adding this upfront context, you’ll notice:
- Fewer hallucinations
- More relevant responses
- Less back-and-forth prompting

🔐 In cyber, where precision and clarity are non-negotiable, this one technique will significantly improve the quality and consistency of your AI outputs.

**Start every AI prompt like you're briefing a new team member. Context isn't optional—it's foundational.**
