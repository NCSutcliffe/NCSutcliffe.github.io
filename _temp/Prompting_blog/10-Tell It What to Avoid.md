# Post 10: Tell It What to Avoid

Sometimes what you exclude matters more than what you include.

In cybersecurity, ambiguity can lead to wasted effort or—worse—misinformation.

Don’t just tell AI what to do. Tell it what not to do.

Examples:
✅ “Summarise the breach, but do NOT mention the vendor name.”
✅ “Rewrite the policy section, but avoid using the word 'monitoring'—it triggers legal reviews.”
✅ “Focus on endpoint controls, not network or identity.”

This works particularly well when:
- Handling regulated content
- Working with execs who dislike jargon
- Writing for legal, HR, or compliance

AI isn’t reading your mind. If a phrase, idea, or scope should be excluded—say it.

**Prompting is precision work. Cut the fluff and call the boundaries.**
