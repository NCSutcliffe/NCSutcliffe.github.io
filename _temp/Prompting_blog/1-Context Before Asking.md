# Post 1: Provide Context Before Asking

In cybersecurity, AI can be powerful, but only if you teach it the rules of your game. Security professionals often expect Copilot or ChatGPT to "just know" what to do—but without context, you're rolling the dice.

If you're building a prompt for AI, consider this your golden rule: **Don't ask a question until you've set the scene.**

🧠 Think of it like onboarding a junior SOC analyst:
- Would you give them an empty prompt like "Summarise this"?
- Or would you say: "This is a monthly threat report for the banking sector. I want you to extract top ransomware trends, but ignore the geopolitical section."

It’s that level of guidance AI needs too.

Here’s how to frame it:
✅ “You’re an Information Security Manager at a financial services firm.”
✅ “This is a weekly endpoint detection report.”
✅ “Our audience is a CIO who wants key actions in plain English.”

By simply adding this upfront context, you’ll notice:
- Fewer hallucinations
- More relevant responses
- Less back-and-forth prompting

🔐 In cyber, where precision and clarity are non-negotiable, this one technique will significantly improve the quality and consistency of your AI outputs.

**Start every AI prompt like you're briefing a new team member. Context isn't optional—it's foundational.**

**About the series**

🔒 About the Secure by Prompt Series
Secure by Prompt is a 10-part blog series designed to demystify the use of generative AI in security operations—specifically how to harness large language models (LLMs) like Microsoft Security Copilot through effective prompt engineering.
Across this series, we move from foundational prompting techniques to sophisticated “mega prompts” that streamline threat detection, investigation, and data protection. The first half focuses on real-world Defender XDR scenarios, while the second explores Microsoft Purview, Intune, and Identity use cases. Each post is rich in technical detail but accessible to security practitioners at any level—designed to help you unlock AI safely, responsibly, and with purpose.

This is your hands-on guide to mastering security prompt engineering—making AI not just useful, but secure by default.
