# Post 4: Use Iteration and Feedback Loops

No great prompt is born perfect.

Security professionals who thrive with AI treat it like a dialogue, not a search box. Your first prompt is step one—refinement is where the magic happens.

Example prompt flow:
1️⃣ “List the top unmanaged device risks in finance.”
2️⃣ “Add examples relevant to remote workers.”
3️⃣ “Now summarise in bullet points under 100 words.”
4️⃣ “Make it suitable for inclusion in a policy document.”

Each loop tightens the output toward your real goal.

Benefits of this approach:
- It mimics how humans refine documents
- Helps AI align with your tone and depth
- Makes complex ideas more usable

You wouldn't expect a new policy to be perfect on the first draft. So why expect that from AI?

Prompt. Review. Adjust. Repeat.

**Treat your prompts like a feedback conversation—not a transaction.**
