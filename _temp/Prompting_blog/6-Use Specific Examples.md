# Post 6: Use Specific Examples

Generic prompts get generic answers.

To unlock high-impact results from AI, feed it specificity—especially when you're dealing with nuanced topics like data protection, threat modeling, or insider risk.

Example:
❌ “Write a policy for phishing prevention.”
✅ “We’ve had a 20% increase in credential phishing via LinkedIn. Create a staff-facing awareness section that addresses this channel directly.”

Another:
❌ “List data loss scenarios.”
✅ “Give me 5 examples of data exfiltration specific to financial services, including one involving a misconfigured Power BI dashboard.”

Why this works:
- Context sharpens accuracy
- Relevance improves immediately
- AI adapts to your real-world environment

AI is capable of impressive detail—but only when you give it a foothold.

**The more precise the example, the more precise the response.**
