# Post 5: Break Big Tasks into Smaller Steps

Ever asked AI to “Create a comprehensive security incident response plan”? You likely got something vague or overwhelming.

AI thrives when you deconstruct large, abstract tasks into manageable components.

Instead of:
❌ “Write our AI usage policy.”

Try:
✅ “List the key sections of an AI usage policy for a bank.”
✅ “Write the introduction paragraph.”
✅ “Now summarise the responsibilities section.”

It mirrors how we’d brief a colleague:
- Step-by-step
- Scoped tasks
- Frequent checkpoints

Security projects often demand layered detail. Asking AI to build an entire security framework in one go is like asking someone to design a skyscraper without a blueprint.

**Prompt AI like you’re managing a junior team member. Give them one brick at a time.**

This way, you:
- Maintain control of scope
- Reduce hallucinations
- Get modular, reusable outputs

In AI prompting, chunking isn't just helpful—it’s essential.
