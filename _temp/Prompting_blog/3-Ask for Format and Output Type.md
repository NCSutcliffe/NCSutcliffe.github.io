# Post 3: Ask for Format and Output Type

In cybersecurity, clarity isn’t just helpful—it’s critical.

Yet many AI prompts fall flat because they don’t specify how the answer should be structured.

The fix? **Be clear about the format you expect.**

Examples:
✅ “List the top 5 insider threats as a table with risk level and mitigation.”
✅ “Convert this policy into a 5-point checklist.”
✅ “Write a plain-language briefing in bullet points for our CIO.”

When you define the output type:
- You reduce ambiguity
- The content becomes instantly usable
- You save time in post-processing

AI can generate:
- Bullet lists
- Summaries
- Tables
- Memos
- Diagrams (with the right plugin)

So ask for what you need.

Security teams don't have time to interpret vague essays. Give the prompt a format, and the AI will follow it—just like a well-trained analyst.

**Clarity of output begins with clarity in the prompt.**
