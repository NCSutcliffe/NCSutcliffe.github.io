# Post 9: Use Tone Instructions

Cybersecurity communication isn’t one-size-fits-all.

Sometimes you need a plain-language explainer. Other times you need a formal policy tone or even an urgent incident brief.

AI can adapt to any of these—but only if you ask.

Try:
✅ “Rewrite this response with a calm, reassuring tone suitable for a phishing alert email.”
✅ “Make this sound like a lawyer wrote it—compliance-focused, cautious wording.”
✅ “Write this SOC escalation note in a direct, action-oriented style.”

Tone affects:
- Trust
- Clarity
- Stakeholder reaction

Even simple tasks like rewriting an MFA guide benefit from tone awareness. You wouldn't send legal language to a helpdesk. Nor a casual tone to the regulator.

**Control the voice, and you control the outcome. Prompt for tone deliberately.**
