| **1. Stop Writing Prompts Like Emails. Start Using the PTCF Framework.**<br><br>Prompting isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúask and hope.‚Äù High-quality outputs start with structure. One of the best frameworks I‚Äôve seen is *PTCF*: Persona, Task, Context, Format.<br><br>üîπ *Persona*: Who should the AI be? ("You're a CISO with 20 years of experience‚Ä¶")<br>üîπ *Task*: What should it do? ("‚Ä¶evaluate this phishing response plan‚Ä¶")<br>üîπ *Context*: What does it need to know? ("‚Ä¶based on the 2023 threat trends.")<br>üîπ *Format*: What should the output look like? ("‚Ä¶presented as a bullet list with risk scores.")<br><br>This structured approach isn‚Äôt tied to any one AI‚Äîit‚Äôs a prompt engineering principle. And it *works*. | cybersecurity strategist at whiteboard, modern office, focused, DSLR, soft light                              |
| **2. Think Like a Developer: Break Prompts Into Functions**<br><br>Ever tried to get AI to do too much at once and ended up with a half-baked answer?<br><br>Break complex asks into modular prompts, just like developers break code into functions.<br><br>Example:<br>1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify high-risk data exfiltration attempts<br>2Ô∏è‚É£ Map detection to MITRE ATT\&CK<br>3Ô∏è‚É£ Recommend automated responses<br><br>This multi-step prompt design gives you clarity, depth, and control‚Äîno matter the platform you're using.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | software developer sketching code, tech lab, methodical, mirrorless camera, high contrast                     |
| **3. Ask AI to Play a Role‚ÄîThen Watch the Magic Happen**<br><br>Want sharper threat analysis or better policy summaries? Give your AI a *hat to wear*.<br><br>üß† Instead of ‚Äúsummarise this report,‚Äù try:<br>‚ÄúYou are a Security Operations Lead at a large bank. Summarise this XDR report for the CIO, highlighting financial risk.‚Äù<br><br>Role-based prompting injects perspective and purpose‚Äîespecially helpful in cybersecurity where nuance matters.<br><br>Different roles = different insights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | cyber analyst in SOC, dark room with screens, intense, wide-angle lens, cinematic colour grading              |
| **4. Use AI to Simulate Red vs Blue**<br><br>Adversarial thinking is at the heart of good security. So why not simulate it?<br><br>Prompt the AI:<br>‚ÄúAs a red teamer, find weak IAM points in this architecture.‚Äù<br>Then flip it:<br>‚ÄúAs a blue team lead, build defences against those exploits.‚Äù<br><br>Suddenly, you‚Äôve got a simulated security tabletop from one prompt thread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | digital chessboard with red and blue teams, cyber battleground, strategic, DSLR, clean processing             |
| **5. Ground Your Prompts in Real Data**<br><br>AI is only as useful as the context you give it.<br>Want better summaries or insights? Ground it in documents, transcripts, logs, or spreadsheets.<br><br>Example: ‚ÄúBased on the attached Q2 risk report and these meeting notes, summarise top 3 regulatory concerns.‚Äù<br><br>Prompt grounding isn‚Äôt platform-specific‚Äîit‚Äôs prompt discipline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | person analysing spreadsheets and reports, open-plan office, analytical, medium format, balanced colour grade |
| **6. The Power of Constraints: Be Specific, Not Vague**<br><br>More specific = better output.<br>Instead of ‚Äúexplain data loss prevention,‚Äù try:<br>‚ÄúIn 4 bullet points, explain DLP to a non-technical senior exec using relatable analogies. Keep it under 150 words.‚Äù<br><br>Constraints force clarity and creativity‚Äîespecially useful in cybersecurity where precision counts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | security concept written in bullets on notepad, wooden desk, concise, DSLR, vignette                          |
| **7. Use Prompts to Clarify, Not Just Create**<br><br>AI isn‚Äôt just a content machine‚Äîit‚Äôs a clarity tool.<br><br>Paste your own email, report, or policy and ask:<br>‚ÄúHow can I make this more concise?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIs the tone professional and clear for a regulator?‚Äù<br><br>Prompting can improve *your* writing too‚Äîmaking you clearer, faster, and more persuasive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | person reviewing draft on laptop, creative workspace, thoughtful, mirrorless, soft grain                      |
| **8. Build Your Own Specialist Assistant (and Keep It Reusable)**<br><br>One-off prompts are great‚Äîbut reusable AI assistants are where scale lives.<br><br>Create prompt templates or ‚Äúpersonas‚Äù that you can reapply:<br>üìÑ ‚ÄúYou are an ISO27001 auditor.‚Äù<br>üìÑ ‚ÄúYou are a privacy policy translator for global compliance teams.‚Äù<br><br>These aren‚Äôt locked to Google or OpenAI‚Äîthey‚Äôre universal prompt assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | AI assistant avatar beside user, digital workspace, functional, DSLR, stylised lighting                       |
| **9. Meeting Overload? Summarise with Purpose**<br><br>Prompt: ‚ÄúSummarise this Teams meeting transcript. Highlight security decisions, unresolved actions, and name owners with deadlines.‚Äù<br><br>It's not just about recap‚Äîit's about clarity and accountability.<br><br>This turns a 45‚Äëminute conversation into a focused operational brief.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | screenshot-style meeting summary, virtual call, clean, smartphone camera, mild blur                           |
| **10. Don‚Äôt Trust Blindly: Review AI Outputs With a Critical Eye**<br><br>AI is a co-pilot, not an oracle. In cybersecurity, hallucinations = risk.<br><br>Prompt it to check itself:<br>‚ÄúHighlight any uncertain assumptions or unverified statements in this draft policy.‚Äù<br><br>This gives you a second layer of QA before anything leaves your desk.<br><br>Human-in-the-loop isn't optional. It's responsible prompt engineering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | person marking red lines on document, well-lit office, careful, DSLR, high clarity                            |
