# Post 2: State the Role or Persona

AI is a shape-shifter. The better you define the role it should take, the better it performs.

In the cybersecurity world, we engage with a wide range of personas: CISOs, SOC analysts, auditors, privacy officers, developers. When you're prompting an AI assistant, explicitly telling it what "hat" to wear will drastically improve its output.

Example:
❌ “What should we include in a risk summary?”
✅ “You are an Information Security Risk Manager. Create a one-page executive summary outlining the top risks of shadow IT for a non-technical audience.”

This small tweak instantly:
- Tailors the tone and depth
- Reduces irrelevant content
- Aligns the response with your real-world goals

Try:
- “Act as a Privacy Officer reviewing a DSR process.”
- “You're a SOC Analyst investigating an email alert.”
- “You're a Data Loss Prevention specialist reviewing outbound traffic.”

Just like any team member, AI does better when it knows its job. And in prompt engineering, roles aren’t assumptions—they’re instructions.

**Define the persona clearly. You’ll see clarity in return.**
