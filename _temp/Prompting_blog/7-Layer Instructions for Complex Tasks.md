# Post 7: Layer Instructions for Complex Tasks

Complex security prompts require more than one instruction. Think of it like writing a mini brief.

Instead of:
❌ “Summarise this report.”

Try:
✅ “You're an Infosec Manager. Summarise this 15-page audit report into a 200-word email for non-technical execs. Focus on remediation priorities and omit vendor jargon.”

That’s 4 layers in one:
- Role
- Input length
- Output type
- Style/tone

By layering instructions, you:
- Pre-empt ambiguity
- Guide the structure
- Avoid having to re-prompt

AI isn't reading between the lines—it’s reading the lines. Be deliberate.

Layering also works for technical tasks:
✅ “You’re a cloud security engineer. Review this Azure policy and identify any configuration drift. Present findings in a table: setting, baseline, deviation.”

Each layer adds precision.

**The more layers, the less friction. Be surgical in how you instruct.**
