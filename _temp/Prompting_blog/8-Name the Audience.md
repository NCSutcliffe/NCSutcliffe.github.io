# Post 8: Name the Audience

Security content written for “everyone” often works for no one.

When prompting AI, **define the audience** with the same care you’d use in stakeholder communications.

Examples:
✅ “Write a summary of this DLP incident for our Board Risk Committee—focus on business impact, not technicals.”
✅ “Rephrase this explanation for junior security interns, with analogies where appropriate.”

Naming the audience ensures:
- The right tone (executive vs. technical)
- The right vocabulary (plain language vs. specialist terms)
- The right focus (strategic vs. operational)

In AI terms, this is prompt targeting. It’s the difference between a usable output and a rewrite job.

AI is a communication engine. You just have to tune it to the listener.

**Want clarity from your AI? Tell it who it’s talking to.**
